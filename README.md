A library I made to aid me in making games for the TI-84+CE with the CE C Toolchain (https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)

Current Features:
► A simple implementation of key debouncing (just pressed, just released, and just pressed or released)
► A way to get the delta time since the last frame
► A few functions to allow for 2D eased animations
