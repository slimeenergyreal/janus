A library I made to aid me in making games for the TI-84+CE with the CE C Toolchain (https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)  
  
Current Features:  
- Simple key debouncing
- Quick way to get frame delta time
- A system for positional easing with the following eases: LINEAR, QUAD_IN, QUAD_OUT, and QUAD_IN_OUT
- A system for drawing animated sprites with variable frame lengths
- A system for updating and drawing a "QuickUI" for rapid prototyping.
- A method for quick and easy screen-shakes.
- A limited physics system
